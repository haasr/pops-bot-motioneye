# pops-bot-motioneye
A rudimentary Python program which utilizes a GroupMe bot to make basic conversation and provide functionality to communicate with a MotionEyeOS camera on LAN by communicating with the GroupMe API through GET and POST requests using the requests library.

This is a proof-of-concept and does not implement any exception handling at the moment. My code is based off of a tutorial from http://sweb.uky.edu/~jtba252/index.php/2017/09/13/how-to-write-a-groupme-bot-using-python/ which I greatly appreciate.
