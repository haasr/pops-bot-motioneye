# pops-bot-motioneye
A rudimentary Python program which utilizes a GroupMe bot to make basic conversation and provide functionality to communicate with a MotionEyeOS camera on LAN by communicating with the GroupMe API and MotionEye host through GET and POST requests using the Python requests library. My cam is set up to monitor my pet chicken --Popcorn-- and the responses returned from the GroupMe bot are meant to immitate her personality.

This is a proof-of-concept and does not implement any exception handling at the moment. My code is based off of a tutorial from http://sweb.uky.edu/~jtba252/index.php/2017/09/13/how-to-write-a-groupme-bot-using-python/ which I greatly appreciate.
